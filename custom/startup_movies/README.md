# Steam Deck Startup Movies Installer

A simple script to deploy custom startup movies on the Steam Deck.  
It copies `.webm` and `.jpg` files from the script folder into Steamâ€™s UI overrides folder.

- `.webm` â†’ the actual startup movie that plays on startup.  
- `.jpg` â†’ a clean thumbnail that appears in Steamâ€™s options menu.  

Can add additional files and rerun to update.

## ðŸ“‚ How It Works

- **Source folder:** The same folder as the script itself.  
- **Target folder:** `~/.steam/steam/config/uioverrides/movies/`  
- **Behavior:**  
  - Creates the target folder if it doesnâ€™t exist.  
  - Copies `.webm` and `.jpg` files.  
  - Skips files that already exist (wonâ€™t overwrite).

## ðŸš€ Installation

1. Place `install-startup-movies.sh` in a folder with your `.webm` and `.jpg` files.  
2. Make the script executable:

3. Run the script:

4. Go to Customisation in Steam and take your pick.
